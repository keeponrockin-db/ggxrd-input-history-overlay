# ggxrd-input-history-overlay
This app recreates GGXrd's input history display in a web app, so you can view live input history data outside of training mode and replays. The app can be directly imported as a local browser source in OBS to look seamless on any streams or recordings. 

## Prerequisites 

You must install Pangaea's mod (https://github.com/super-continent/ggxrd-mod/) before running this app.

## Adding to OBS

1) Download the code as a zip file and extract the contents.
2) In OBS Studio, create a new browser source
3) Check the Local file option, browse to the extracted code and select index.html
4) Set the width to 1920 and the height to 1080
